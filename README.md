# FOC King Board Assembly Guide

This repository documents my process of building the FOC King motor controller board, originally designed by the team at [nordstream3/FOC](https://github.com/nordstream3/FOC).

## Motivation

While building this board myself, I decided to take detailed photos at each step of the assembly. The official documentation is a great resource, but my board was a little bit diffrent.
