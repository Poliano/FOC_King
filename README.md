# FOC King Board Assembly Guide

This repository documents my process of building the FOC King motor controller board, originally designed by the team at [nordstream3/FOC](https://github.com/nordstream3/FOC).

## Motivation

While building this board, I decided to take detailed photos at each step of the assembly. The official documentation is a great resource, but the board I assembled had some minor differences. This guide is intended to be a visual walkthrough to help others through the process.

### Assembly Tips

**Clearance for SMD Components**

Ensure there is a sufficient gap between your solder joints and nearby Surface-Mount Devices (SMD) to prevent accidental solder bridges or shorts.

**Installing the MOSFETs**

When installing the MOSFETs, you may need to sand down the pins slightly so they fit through the PCB holes more easily. This allows the MOSFETs to sit completely flat against the PCB.

By ensuring they are flush, you can later screw a heatsink on top, which creates firm pressure for better heat transfer. This is more effective than relying only on the adhesion of a thermal pad.
